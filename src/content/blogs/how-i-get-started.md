*[CS]: Computer Science
*[IS]: Information Systems

2019 marks my 2 years of working professionally as a Software Developer. Everyday, I enjoy what I do (*that's a lie* üòú). Of course, there are frustrations with the job: difficult clients, hard-to-solve programming problems, or indecisive management.

Programming was not my first **career choice** but it was my first **career** and programming has also become a huge part of my life. In today's blog, I want to share with you all about:

## Before Programming

In 2010, I moved to the USA at the age of 19 and literally started over üôÄ. I went to college for **Computer Science (CS)** at first without knowing what **CS** really was. I was just going with it because there's the word "computer" in it. However in 2012, I decided to drop **CS** because I couldn't understand a single word in *Engineering Physics* class. Had I tried better with my English, I might have had a chance to stay with **CS**. After dropping *physics* class, I switched to **Information Systems (IS)** major and started preparing to transfer to a 4-year institution. üè´

After the transfer, I started working at this warehouse which deals with Medical Supplies. The *young* me realized then I liked the way products are organized and distributed. Basically, I was almost *tricking* myself into thinking I liked Operational stuffs. Then, I decided to lean towards Business side of **IS** instead of Technical side. How wrong I was!! Last semester came, I had to pass this Capstone class where students have to get in teams, go out to look for our own clients, and solve their business pains using Technology. I was like "I am a Documentations guy" but then I slowly took a role of a Programmer because our team lacked technical people. I wasn't really sure about my skill at all but little did I know, that decision literally changed my career path. That's truly when I started **Programming**. üíª

> Disclaimer: I did take programming courses in the previous semesters but I really didn't pay attention because I truly thought I was going to be a *business man*. üìàüìâ

## When Programming

For this Capstone class project, our team picked the **MEAN Stack**. For those of you who have no clues, **MEAN** stands for:

1. **MongoDB**: The most popular NoSQL database
2. **ExpressJS**: The most popular NodeJS framework used to build Web Server
3. **Angular (Angular 2+)**: One of the most popular JS Frontend frameworks developed by Google
4. **NodeJS**: JavaScript Runtime that enables running JavaScript outside of the Browser (eg: on the server)

Sounds super cool to me, to be honest. Well, I didn't really know anything about any of these 4 technologies. Eventually, I was tasked with working on the `HTML` portion of the `Angular` side then I closely learned `Angular` (*Yeah, I know. Scary, right?! `Angular` before `JavaScript`* üò≤). Long story short, the following list was my "achievements":

1. Spent 150+ hours in the lab learning the **MEAN** stack with my friend
2. Quit my warehouse job about a week after midterm. My friend was like "WT...?!"
3. Got the project finished and graduated with a Bachelor Degree in **IS**
4. And most importantly, I realized my passion - **Programming**

I thought it was super cool and super rewarding when something that didn't exist came to life through our hard work + technologies and that something actually helped a business grow. Next thing I know, I was determined to teach myself how to be a better programmer. Here's how.

## How Programming

After graduation, I was ... **jobless** and **broke**. Honestly, I could have just gone back to my old warehouse job and applied for a higher position in the company but **I WANTED TO CODE**. In addition, it was extremely frustrated at the time because my wife just came to live with me, a **broke** husband ‚òπÔ∏è. On positive note, my wife was very understanding and she was the one who pushed me towards my passion. For 3 months straight after graduation, I coded for 14-16 hours a day for 3 months. My Udemy account was growing like crazy (*I know I know, I was tricked by those 9.99 too üòÖ*). Below was a shorten list of the courses I took:

1. [Angular 4 Front To Back](https://www.udemy.com/angular-4-front-to-back/learn/)
2. [The Complete Angular Master Class](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-angular-master-class/learn/) 
3. [Angular Full App With Angular Material Angularfire Ngrx](https://www.udemy.com/angular-full-app-with-angular-material-angularfire-ngrx/learn/) 
4. [Nodejs Express Mongodb Dev To Deployment](https://www.udemy.com/nodejs-express-mongodb-dev-to-deployment/learn/)  

...and a couple more from different sites. During the 3 months of practicing, I also started rebuilding my Capstone's project (*Again, I know, no creativity* üòÖ). But, the good thing was I wrote much better code in this rebuild over what we did in the Capstone class and the time it took was much shorter as well. I'm talking about 2 weeks versus 4 months ü§Ø.

Next, I started applying for Developer jobs. And it was hard. I had no previous experience, no internship under my belt, and had not gone over any official **CS** courses. I applied for tons of positions, maybe got one call or two back. Long story short, I was still **jobless** and **broke** 3 months after graduation. My wife was frustrated, I was desperate. Then, I contacted my friend from the old team in the Capstone class and learned that he was working for a Dev Shop (*basically, a consultant company but we like to call it Dev Shop*). That friend introduced me to his boss, Kevin, which is my current boss and I did land an interview with them. I was nervous and happy at the same time thinking: "I cannot screw this up". Show up for the interview, my interviewer, Chris, made the interview super casual. We talked about how I learned, what I already knew and I got to show my **Capstone-project-rebuild** and talked about how I did it, what I could have done better. Long story short, somehow they gave me a shot for a Contractor position. That's OK. I will do my best - I said. To me, I was, and still am, extremely truly grateful towards my bosses and my friend who literally trusted and gave me an opportunity in a life time. On 11th Oct 2017, I started my first job as a Developer. That's how I **programming**.

## Why Programming

As I mentioned earlier, I found it's rewarding to be creating impacting products that will either realize one's dream or make the dream better. It also makes my passion becomes a reality. I just love programming, man. For the past year, I've learned so much from people around me and I've also made many friends along the way. Programming have been opening so many different doors for me where I feel joy doing what I love. I go to meetups to see, hear, and talk to like-minded people. I join online programming communities to share my experience and knowledge. The whole thing has been rewarding both mentally and financially. It makes my marriage less stressful, my wife less doubtful about her leaving her family, friends, and job in Vietnam to come to me.

All of these things will always remind me about how I get started and the people that were there in the beginning of my career for which they helped *launched*. Because of that, I will still keep learning about programming, and keep sharing what I've learned with others. That brings uttermost joy to me whenever I can use my knowledge to help others, to enlighten others, and to inspire others. 

## The Present

Currently, I am still a **Software Developer** at **[ArchitectNow](http://architectnow.net)**. However, I give myself a title of: **TypeScript Enthusiast**. I love **TypeScript** and have done so many things with it:

1. I continue to get better at **[Angular](https://angular.io)** which uses **TypeScript** as its main programming language
2. I discovered **[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)**, a progressive **NodeJS** framework, which uses **TypeScript**
3. I get to learn **[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org)** and apply **TypeScript** with it. And it is **AWESOME**
4. I created a library called **[automapper-nartc](https://github.com/nartc/automapper-nartc)** to learn even more about **TypeScript**. (*the library is actually working, just FYI* üòõ)
5. I created a **NestJS** tutorial series on Youtube
   - Repository: [nest-mean](https://github.com/nartc/nest-mean)
   - Youtube: [MEAN Stack with NestJS Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj_MMY15g6w)
6. I just built my blog with **React**, **Gatsby** and **TypeScript**. You can check out how I built this blog [here](https://nartc.netlify.com/blogs/how-i-build-this-blog/)
7. ...and more. If you catch me on social media, I'll tell more.

I can't believe that it has been almost 2 years since I started on this path and I do not regret any of it. I have many plans in the near future that I will keep updated through this blog. So stay tuned. Check out my socials if you want to reach out. Thanks for reading and I will see you around.
